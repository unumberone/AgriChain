## Introduction
AgriChain is a blockchain-powered platform that connects farmers and customers directly, ensuring fair pricing, transparency, and sustainability in agriculture through smart contracts and AI-driven insights.

## Pain Points in Farming
The agricultural sector faces many challenges that impact both farmers and customers. Here are some of the key pain points we observed:

### 1. Unfair Pricing & Market Access
- Middlemen reduce farmers' earnings and limit direct market access.
- Price fluctuations cause income instability.

### 2. Lack of Transparency in Supply Chain
- customers can't verify product authenticity or pricing fairness.
- Absence of proper tracking of agricultural goods.

### 3. Limited Access to Market Intelligence
- Lack of real-time market data, pricing insights, and data-driven crop optimization.
- Limited knowledge sharing and access to learning resources for farmers.

## Motive
As students focused on real-world problem-solving, we created this solution to help farmers get fair pricing, better market access, and more transparency. By using blockchain and AI, we aim to build a practical system that benefits both farmers and customers.

## Solution  
Our solution connects farmers and customers directly, ensuring fair pricing and transparency. Farmers can register farms, list products with cost breakdowns, and receive AI-driven insights. An algorithm determines fair pricing based on costs, market trends, and sustainability. Smart contracts record transactions and verify authenticity. The platform also supports decentralized crowdfunding and surplus crop donations to NGOs.
